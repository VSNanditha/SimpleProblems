# A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by one of the following properties:
#
# * It can be empty (null).
# * It contains a root node only.
# * It contains a root node with a left subtree, a right subtree, or both. These subtrees are also binary trees.
#
# In-order traversal is performed as
#
# 1. Traverse the left subtree.
# 2. Visit root.
# 3. Traverse the right subtree.
#
# For this in-order traversal, start from the left child of the root node and keep exploring the left subtree until
# you reach a leaf. When you reach a leaf, back up to its parent, check for a right child and visit it if there is one.
# If there is not a child, you've explored its left and right subtrees fully. If there is a right child, traverse its
# left subtree then its right in the same manner. Keep doing this until you have traversed the entire tree. You will
# only store the values of a node as you visit when one of the following is true:
#
# * it is the first node visited, the first time visited
# * it is a leaf, should only be visited once
# * all of its subtrees have been explored, should only be visited once while this is true
# * it is the root of the tree, the first time visited
#
# Swapping: Swapping subtrees of a node means that if initially node has left subtree L and right subtree R, then after
# swapping, the left subtree will be R and the right subtree, L.
#
# For example, in the following tree, we swap children of node 1.
#
#                                 Depth
#     1               1            [1]
#    / \             / \
#   2   3     ->    3   2          [2]
#    \   \           \   \
#     4   5           5   4        [3]
#
# In-order traversal of left tree is 2 4 1 3 5 and of right tree is 3 5 1 2 4.
#
# Swap operation:
#
# We define depth of a node as follows:
#
# * The root node is at depth 1.
# * If the depth of the parent node is d, then the depth of current node will be d+1.
#
# Given a tree and an integer, k, in one operation, we need to swap the subtrees of all the nodes at each depth h,
# where h âˆˆ [k, 2k, 3k,...]. In other words, if h is a multiple of k, swap the left and right subtrees of that level.
#
# You are given a tree of n nodes where nodes are indexed from [1..n] and it is rooted at 1. You have to perform t swap
# operations on it, and after each swap operation print the in-order traversal of the current state of the tree.
#
# Function Description
#
# Complete the swapNodes function in the editor below. It should return a two-dimensional array where each element is
# an array of integers representing the node indices of an in-order traversal after a swap operation.
#
# swapNodes has the following parameter(s):
# - indexes: an array of integers representing index values of each node[i], beginning with node[1], the first element,
#   as the root.
# - queries: an array of integers, each representing a k value.
#
# Input Format
# The first line contains n, number of nodes in the tree.
#
# Each of the next n lines contains two integers, a b, where a is the index of left child, and b is the index of right
# child of ith node.
#
# Note: -1 is used to represent a null node.
#
# The next line contains an integer, t, the size of queries.
# Each of the next t lines contains an integer queries[i], each being a value k.
#
# Output Format
# For each k, perform the swap operation and store the indices of your in-order traversal to your result array.
# After all swap operations have been performed, return your result array for printing.
#
# Constraints
#
# * 1 <= n <= 1024
# * 1 <= t <= 100
# * 1 <= k <= n
# * Either a = -1 or 2 <= a <= n
# * Either b = -1 or 2 <= b <= n
# * The index of a non-null child will always be greater than that of its parent.
